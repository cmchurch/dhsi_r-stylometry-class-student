* DAY 1 *
*********

Comparing texts: whether there are relations between different texts
- authorship: can we extract some lexical features that allow us to tell who the author is?
- extend the notion to measure differences between texts
- seems to be always relational (could be adapted for year by year?)

*********
*History*
*********
- goes back to Lorenzo Valla and the Donation of Constantine (forgery) to see if it was real; allegedly written by the emperor of Constantine to give the pope the right to lands
- counted grammatical mistakes that could not have been done by a native speaker of the Greek language four centuries earlier
- feudal terminology in use throughout that wasn't in use; anachronisms throughout

1851/1887 Shakespeare authorship question -- the initial idea of measuring language
 - Augustus de Morgan (1806-187)
     - opened the question of Shakespeare authorship with a really short letter saying, 
     "hey, maybe we might look into this!"
 - Thomas C Mendenhall (1841-1924)
     - started looking into it
     
1888: authorship of Pauline Epistles
 - William Benjamin Smith (aka Conrad Mascol, 1850-1934)
 - St. Paul's Epistles written by multiple people
 
1890: chronology of Plato's dialogues:
 - Wincenty Lutoslawksi -(1864-1964) - coined term stylometry
 - assess the development of Plato's logic, and to do so he needed to know the chronology

1980s: John Burrows, book on Jane Austen - Computation and Criticism
 - bring stylometry back to the domain of literary studies
 - sparked a great number of studies looking at authorship in literary sources

*WHAT IS STYLOMETRY*
********************
- language doesn't matter, but comparing across languages is really hard
- measure the words as they appear in the text, also can lemmitize
- bag o' words that needs to be counted and then sorted, and then we compare them
   - create frequency profiles and then compare them one to another
   - use dendrogram to identify groups of texts
        - Grouping of texts based on features
        - also able to identify plagiarism
          - Mysterious Mr. Robert Galbraiht - book did poorly, but turns out it was by JK
            Rowling, so then the sales sky-rocketed
   - imitation
   - translation, even if translated the signal of an author still exists in a different
     language (the Dickens signal), but is the trace of the translater still there, but it is
     rather weak
   - what are the relations between characters in a book
   
Text is not just one signal, but you have to separate the signal from the noise - key is figuring out how to isolate them and tell them apart
